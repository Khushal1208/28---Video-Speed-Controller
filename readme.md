### **🌟 Day 28: Video Speed Controller | #30Days30Projects**  

Today, I built a **custom video speed controller** that allows users to **adjust playback speed dynamically** by simply hovering over a slider! 🎥⚡ This project enhances the user experience by giving them full control over video speed in an intuitive way.  

### 🔹 **Key Features:**  
✔️ **Hover-based speed control** for smooth adjustments 🎛️  
✔️ **Dynamic UI updates** to display current playback speed 📊  
✔️ **Custom speed range** (0.4x to 4x) for flexibility 🔄  
✔️ **Real-time feedback** with a visually responsive speed bar 🎨  

### 🔍 **Key Learnings:**  
✅ **Handling `mousemove` events** to track user interaction 📌  
✅ **Using `pageY` & `offsetHeight`** to calculate percentage-based speed ⚖️  
✅ **Dynamically updating `playbackRate`** for real-time speed control 🚀  
✅ **Modifying CSS properties dynamically** for smooth UI transitions ✨

### 💡 **Real-World Applications:**  
📌 **Online learning platforms** (adjusting lecture speed) 📚  
📌 **Video editing software** (previewing clips at different speeds) 🎬  
📌 **Media players** for better playback control 🎵  
📌 **Gaming replays** (watching in slow motion or fast forward) 🎮  

Building interactive UI components like this **deepens my JavaScript skills** and helps me understand **real-time event handling**. Can't wait for **Day 29**! 🚀🔥
